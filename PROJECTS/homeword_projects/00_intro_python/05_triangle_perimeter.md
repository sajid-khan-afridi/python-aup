## Problem Statement

Prompt the user to enter the lengths of each side of a triangle and then calculate and print the perimeter of the triangle (the sum of all of the side lengths).

Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in bold italics):

What is the length of side 1? 3 

What is the length of side 2? 4 

What is the length of side 3? 5.5 

The perimeter of the triangle is 12.5
